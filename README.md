# MachineLearning
My first experiments with Machine Learning (TensorFlow in Jupyter notebook).

## Projects

My [first project](creditcard/ML1CreditCard.ipynb) uses a Jupyter notebook and an example list of a quarter of a million credit card transaction 
to make a neural network that detects the fraudulent ones.

My [second project](fruitfind/fruitfind.ipynb) classifies 131 species of fruit (and vegetables and nuts).

My [third project](sinus/sinus.ipynb) tries to predict the `sin(x)`. However, the ultimate goal is to map it to C - on an ESP8266.
