# MachineLearning
My first experiments with Machine Learning (TensorFlow in Jupyter notebook).

## Projects

My [first project](creditcard/ML1CreditCard.ipynb) uses a Jupyter notebook and an example list of a quarter of a million credit card transaction 
to make a neural network that detects the fraudulent ones.

My [second project](fruitfind/fruitfind.ipynb) classifies 131 species of fruit (and vegetables and nuts).

My [third project](sine/sine.ipynb) tries to predict the `sin(x)`. 
However, the read goal is to run the model on the ESP32, a goal that is [reached](sine/sine32).
There are two intermezzos. The [first](sine/piecewise-linear.ipynb) maps a piece-wise linear curve to a two-layer neural net.
The [second](sine/piecewise-sine.ipynb) manually programs the neural network weights to have better prediction for sine than after training.
