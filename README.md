# MachineLearning
My first experiments with Machine Learning (TensorFlow in Jupyter notebook).

## Projects

My [first project](creditcard/ML1CreditCard.ipynb) uses a Jupyter notebook and an example list of a quarter of a million credit card transaction 
to make a neural network that detects the fraudulent ones.

My [second project](fruitfind/fruitfind.ipynb) tries to classifies fruit (under construction).
