# MachineLearning
My first experiments with Machine Learning (TensorFlow in Jupyter notebook).

## Projects

My [first project](creditcard/ML1CreditCard.ipynb) uses a Jupyter notebook and an example list of a quarter of a million credit card transaction 
to make a neural network that detects the fraudulent ones.

My [second project](fruitfind/fruitfind.ipynb) classifies 131 species of fruit (and vegetables and nuts).

My [third project](sine/sine.ipynb) tries to predict the `sin(x)`. 
However, the real goal is to run the model on the ESP32, a goal that is [reached](sine/sine32). The same sketch even runs on ESP8266, albeit slower.
There are two intermezzos. The [first](sine/piecewise-linear.ipynb) maps a piece-wise linear curve to a two-layer neural net.

The [forth project](rock-paper-scissors/rock-paper-scissors.ipynb) is no longer to educate me.
This implements rock-paper-scissors on an ESP32. 
In another project, the [ESP32-CAM](https://github.com/maarten-pennings/esp32cam/tree/main/rock-paper-scissors) is used to capture the images.
